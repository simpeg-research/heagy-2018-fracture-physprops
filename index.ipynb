    "Then `cd` into the `heagy-2018-fracture-physprops`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd heagy-2018-fracture-physprops\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "source activate fracture-physprops-environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively, you can install dependencies through pypi\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
